# Study Buddies 

# Background and Overview 

Study Buddies is an app that allows students to be able to create and attend study sessions. These study sessions will be held in libraries across America and can be easily organized by the study session creator. Utilizing the Google Maps API, students will be able to browse available study sessions in their area, create study sessions, and request to join existing study sessions. Study Buddies fosters learning by allowing students to build their network and find peers to study with.
